# 🚀 MLOps Best Practices for Machine Learning Projects

This repository provides practical guidelines and best practices for implementing MLOps principles in your machine learning project. Inspired by the work of <u>[Goku Mohandas](https://www.example.com)</u> on MLOps best practices, we apply these principles to a specific use case of scoring tabular data. From 🎨 design and 📊 data to 🤖 model development, 🚀 deployment, 🧪 testing, ♻️ reproducibility, and 🏭 production, we cover all aspects of MLOps to help you build and maintain effective and scalable machine learning solutions.
