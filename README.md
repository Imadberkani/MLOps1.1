} on MLOps best practices, we apply these principles to a specific use case of scoring tabular data. From 🎨 design and 📊 data to 🤖 model development, 🚀 deployment, 🧪 testing, ♻️ reproducibility, and 🏭 production, we cover all aspects of MLOps to help you build and maintain effective and scalable machine learning solutions.
